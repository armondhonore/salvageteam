#Salvage Team - Rush

Introduction

Space junk has been polluting our solar system for many years now. Its a problem for space travelers and satellites alike. Its time to help clean up this mess. Will you help and earn some credits while your at it?

Salvage Team â€“ RUSH is the first mini-game in a series of fun filled physics scrolling games. You pilot a small ship that collects rubbish (bits and peaces) through a hull magnetic system. Its your task to clean up an area. You are scored on the rubbish collected and the length of time it takes to collect.  Each trash picked up adds 10 points to your score.  If you complete the level in under 60 seconds, you will get bonus points for the time remaining.
